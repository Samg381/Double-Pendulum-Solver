# Double-Pendulum-Solver
Solve for both arm lengths of a double pendulum to achieve desired natural frequencies.

**Description**
This script accepts four inputs: a length and mass for both pendulum arms. 
The length inputs (L1, L2) are guesses; starting points for optomization.
The script will attempt to match the specified masses with the smallest
Possible arm length to achieve natural frequencies of 2Hz and 5Hz.
